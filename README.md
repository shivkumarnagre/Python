**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The design principles for reliability in the AWS Cloud are:
Test recovery procedures. The best way to ensure that systems can recover from failures is to regularly test them using simulated scenarios. This can help identify gaps and improve the recovery process.
Automatically recover from failure. By using automation, systems can detect and correct failures without human intervention. This can reduce the impact and duration of failures and improve the availability of the system.
Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability. By adding more redundant resources to the system, the impact of individual resource failures can be reduced. This can also improve the performance and scalability
of the system.
Stop guessing capacity. By using monitoring and automation, systems can adjust the capacity based on the demand and performance metrics. This can prevent failures due to insufficient or excessive capacity and optimize the
cost and efficiency of the system.
Manage change in automation. By using automation, changes to the system can be applied in a consistent and controlled manner. This can reduce the risk of human errors and configuration drifts that can cause failures. AWS

### Question 10
An Availability Zone consists of:
- [ ] one or more data centers in a single location.
- [ ] two or more data centers in multiple locations.
- [ ] one or more physical hosts in a single data center.
- [ ] two or more physical hosts in multiple data centers.
#### Correct Answer: A
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The #### Correct Answer is A because an Availability Zone consists of one or more data centers in a single location. An Availability Zone is an isolated location within an AWS Region that has independent power, cooling, and
networking. Each Availability Zone has one or more data centers that host the physical servers and storage devices that run the AWS services. The other options are incorrect because they are not accurate descriptions of an
Availability Zone. Two or more data centers in multiple locations are not an Availability Zone, but rather multiple Availability Zones within an AWS Region. One or more physical hosts in a single data center are not an
Availability Zone, but rather the components of a data center within an Availability Zone. Two or more physical hosts in multiple data centers are not an Availability Zone, but rather the components of multiple data centers
within one or more Availability Zones. Reference: [Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones]
### Question 11
A company wants to ensure that two Amazon EC2 instances are in separate data centers with minimal communication latency between the data centers.
How can the company meet this requirement?
- [ ] Place the EC2 instances in two separate AWS Regions connected with a VPC peering connection.
- [ ] Place the EC2 instances in two separate Availability Zones within the same AWS Region.
- [ ] Place one EC2 instance on premises and the other in an AWS Region. Then connect them by using an AWS VPN connection.
- [ ] Place both EC2 instances in a placement group for dedicated bandwidth.
IT Certification Exams - Questions & Answers | VCEplus.io

#### Correct Answer: B
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The #### Correct Answer is B because placing the EC2 instances in two separate Availability Zones within the same AWS Region is the best way to meet the requirement. Availability Zones are isolated locations within an AWS
Region that have independent power, cooling, and networking. Users can launch their resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones to increase the fault tolerance and resilience of their applications.
Availability Zones within the same AWS Region are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. The other options are incorrect because they are not the best ways to meet the
requirement. Placing the EC2 instances in two separate AWS Regions connected with a VPC peering connection is not the best way to meet the requirement because AWS Regions are geographically dispersed and may have
higher communication latency between them than Availability Zones within the same AWS Region. VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables users to route traffic between them
using private IP addresses. Placing one EC2 instance on premises and the other in an AWS Region, and then connecting them by using an AWS VPN connection is not the best way to meet the requirement because onpremises and AWS Region are geographically dispersed and may have higher communication latency between them than Availability Zones within the same AWS Region.
AWS VPN connection is a secure and encrypted connection between a user's network and their VPC.
Placing both EC2 instances in a placement group for dedicated bandwidth is not the best way to meet the requirement because a placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone that enables
users to launch instances with specific performance characteristics. A placement group does not ensure that the instances are in separate data centers, and it does not provide low-latency communication between instances
in different Availability Zones. Reference:
[Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones], [VPC Peering], [AWS VPN], [Placement Groups]

IT Certification Exams - Questions & Answers | VCEplus.io
www.VCEplus.io
means that AWS has a global infrastructure that allows customers to deploy their applications and data across multiple regions and availability zones. This increases the fault tolerance and resilience of their applications and
reduces the impact of failures. Economies of scale means that AWS can achieve lower variable costs than customers can get on their own. This allows customers to pay only for the resources they use and scale up or down as
needed. The other options are incorrect because they are not benefits that a company receives when it moves an on-premises production workload to AWS. AWS trains the company's staff on the use of all the AWS services is
not a benefit that a company receives when it moves an on-premises production workload to AWS. AWS does provide various learning resources and training courses for customers, but it does not train the company's staff on
the use of all the AWS services. AWS manages all security in the cloud is not a benefit that a company receives when it moves an on-premises production workload to AWS. AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, but
the customer is responsible for the security in the cloud. AWS offers free support from technical account managers (TAMs) is not a benefit that a company receives when it moves an on-premises production workload to AWS.
AWS does offer support from TAMs, but only for customers who have the AWS Enterprise Support plan, which is not free.

### Question 82
A company is reviewing the design of an application that will be migrated from on premises to a single Amazon EC2 instance.
What should the company do to make the application highly available?
- [ ] Provision additional EC2 instances in other Availability Zones.
- [ ] Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Assign the EC2 instance as the ALB's target.
- [ ] Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to create the EC2 instance.
- [ ] Provision the application by using an EC2 Spot Instance.
#### Correct Answer: A
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Provisioning additional EC2 instances in other Availability Zones is a way to make the application highly available, as it reduces the impact of failures and increases fault tolerance. Configuring an Application Load Balancer and
assigning the EC2 instance as the ALB's target is a way to distribute traffic among multiple instances, but it does not make the application highly available if there is only one instance. Using an Amazon Machine Image to
create the EC2 instance is a way to launch a virtual server with a preconfigured operating system and software, but it does not make the application highly available by itself. Provisioning the application by using an EC2 Spot
Instance is a way to use spare EC2 capacity at up to 90% off the On-Demand price, but it does not make the application highly available, as Spot Instances can be interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute notification.

permissions, creating security group rules for outbound access, applying Amazon EC2 operating system patches, and other aspects of security in the cloud1.
### Question 98
A company wants to push VPC Flow Logs to an Amazon S3 bucket.
A company wants to optimize long-term compute costs of AWS Lambda functions and Amazon EC2 instances.
Which AWS purchasing option should the company choose to meet these requirements?
- [ ] Dedicated Hosts
- [ ] Compute Savings Plans
- [ ] Reserved Instances
- [ ] Spot Instances
#### Correct Answer: B
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Compute Savings Plans are a flexible and cost-effective way to optimize long-term compute costs of AWS Lambda functions and Amazon EC2 instances. With Compute Savings Plans, customers can commit to a consistent
amount of compute usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1-year or 3-year term and receive a discount of up to 66% compared to On-Demand prices3. Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with EC2 instance capacity fully
dedicated to the customer's use. They are suitable for customers who have specific server-bound software licenses or compliance requirements4. Reserved Instances are a pricing model that provides a significant discount (up
to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing and a capacity reservation for EC2 instances. They are available in 1-year or 3-year terms and different payment options5. Spot Instances are spare EC2 instances that are available at
up to 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices. They are suitable for customers who have flexible start and end times, can withstand interruptions, and can handle excess capacity.
### Question 99
Which task can a company perform by using security groups in the AWS Cloud?
- [ ] Allow access to an Amazon EC2 instance through only a specific port.
- [ ] Deny access to malicious IP addresses at a subnet level.
- [ ] Protect data that is cached by Amazon CloudFront.
- [ ] Apply a stateless firewall to an Amazon EC2 instance.
IT Certification Exams - Questions & Answers | VCEplus.io
www.VCEplus.io
#### Correct Answer: A
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Security groups are virtual firewalls that control the inbound and outbound traffic for Amazon EC2 instances. They can be used to allow access to an Amazon EC2 instance through only a specific port, such as port 22 for SSH
or port 80 for HTTP. Security groups cannot deny access to malicious IP addresses at a subnet level, as they only allow or deny traffic based on the rules defined by the customer. To block malicious IP addresses, customers can
use network ACLs, which are stateless firewalls that can be applied to subnets. Security groups cannot protect data that is cached by Amazon CloudFront, as they only apply to EC2 instances. To protect data that is cached by
Amazon CloudFront, customers can use encryption, signed URLs, or signed cookies. Security groups are not stateless firewalls, as they track the state of the traffic and automatically allow the response traffic to flow back to
the source. Stateless firewalls do not track the state of the traffic and require rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.
### Question 100
Which AWS service or tool provides users with the ability to monitor AWS service quotas?
- [ ] AWS CloudTrail
- [ ] AWS Cost and Usage Reports
- [ ] AWS Trusted Advisor
- [ ] AWS Budgets
#### Correct Answer: C
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The #### Correct Answer is C because AWS Trusted Advisor is an AWS service or tool that provides users with the ability to monitor AWS service quotas. AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides users with real-time
guidance to help them provision their resources following AWS best practices.
One of the categories of checks that AWS Trusted Advisor performs is service limits, which monitors the usage of each AWS service and alerts users when they are close to reaching the default limit. The other options are
incorrect because they are not AWS services or tools that provide users with the ability to monitor AWS service quotas. AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables users to track user activity and API usage across their AWS
account. AWS Cost and Usage Reports is a tool that enables users to access comprehensive information about their AWS costs and usage. AWS Budgets is a tool that enables users to plan their service usage, costs, and
reservations. Reference: [AWS Trusted Advisor FAQs]
### Question 101
Which of the following is an advantage of AWS Cloud computing?
- [ ] Trade security for elasticity.
- [ ] Trade operational excellence for agility.
- [ ] Trade fixed expenses for variable expenses.
- [ ] Trade elasticity for performance.
#### Correct Answer: C
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The #### Correct Answer is C because AWS Cloud computing allows customers to trade fixed expenses for variable expenses. This means that customers only pay for the resources they use, and can scale up or down as needed. The
other options are incorrect because they are not advantages of AWS Cloud computing. Trade security for elasticity means that customers have to compromise on the protection of their data and applications in order to adjust
their capacity quickly. Trade operational excellence for agility means that customers have to sacrifice the quality and reliability of their operations in order to respond to changing needs faster. Trade elasticity for performance
means that customers have to limit their ability to scale up or down in order to achieve higher speed and efficiency.

### Question 102
A company wants to create a chatbot and integrate the chatbot with its current web application.
Which AWS service will meet these requirements?
IT Certification Exams - Questions & Answers | VCEplus.io
www.VCEplus.io
- [ ] AmazonKendra
- [ ] Amazon Lex
- [ ] AmazonTextract
- [ ] AmazonPolly
#### Correct Answer: B
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The AWS service that will meet the requirements of the company that wants to create a chatbot and integrate the chatbot with its current web application is Amazon Lex. Amazon Lex is a service that helps customers build
conversational interfaces using voice and text. The company can use Amazon Lex to create a chatbot that can understand natural language and respond to user requests, using the same deep learning technologies that power
Amazon Alexa. Amazon Lex also provides easy integration with other AWS services, such as Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Polly, and AWS Lambda, as well as popular platforms, such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Twilio.
Amazon Lex helps customers create engaging and interactive chatbots for their web applications. Amazon Kendra, Amazon Textract, and Amazon Polly are not the best services to use for this purpose. Amazon Kendra is a
service that helps customers provide accurate and natural answers to natural language queries using machine learning. Amazon Textract is a service that helps customers extract text and data from scanned documents using
optical character recognition (OCR) and machine learning. Amazon Polly is a service that helps customers convert text into lifelike speech using deep learning. These services are more useful for different types of natural
language processing and generation tasks, rather than creating and integrating chatbots.
### Question 103
Which AWS service is used to temporarily provide federated security credentials to a__________
- [ ] Amazon GuardDuty
- [ ] AWS Simple Token Service (AWS STS)
- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager
- [ ] AWS Certificate Manager
#### Correct Answer: B
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The AWS service that is used to temporarily provide federated security credentials to a user is AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS). AWS STS is a service that enables customers to request temporary, limited-privilege
credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that they authenticate (federated users). The company can use AWS STS to grant federated users access to AWS resources without creating
permanent IAM users or sharing long-term credentials. AWS STS helps customers manage and secure access to their AWS resources for federated users. Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Secrets Manager, and AWS Certificate
Manager are not the best services to use for this purpose. Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior across the AWS accounts and resources. AWS Secrets
Manager is a service that helps customers manage and rotate secrets, such as database credentials, API keys, and passwords. AWS Certificate Manager is a service that helps customers provision, manage, and deploy public
and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and internal connected resources. These services are more useful for different types of security and compliance tasks,
rather than providing temporary federated security credentials to a user.

governance perspective helps organizations ensure that their cloud adoption delivers the expected business value and outcomes, and that their cloud solutions are secure, reliable, and compliant. Operations, people, and
security are other perspectives of the AWS CAF, but they do not directly connect technology and business. The operations perspective focuses on the management and monitoring of the cloud resources and applications, as
well as the automation and optimization of the operational processes. The people perspective focuses on the development and empowerment of the human resources, as well as the transformation of the organizational
culture and structure. The security perspective focuses on the protection of the information assets and systems in the cloud, as well as the implementation of the security policies and controls.
### Question 105
Which task is the responsibility of a company that is using Amazon RDS?
- [ ] Provision the underlying infrastructure.
- [ ] Create 1AM policies to control administrative access to the service.
- [ ] Install the cables to connect the hardware for compute and storage.
- [ ] Install and patch the RDS operating system.
#### Correct Answer: B
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The #### Correct Answer is B because AWS 1AM policies can be used to control administrative access to the Amazon RDS service. The other options are incorrect because they are the responsibilities of AWS, not the company that
is using Amazon RDS. AWS manages the provisioning, cabling, installation, and patching of the underlying infrastructure for Amazon RDS. Reference: Amazon RDS FAQs
### Question 106
A company is running applications on Amazon EC2 instances in the same AWS account for several different projects. The company wants to track the infrastructure costs for each of the projects separately. The company must
conduct this tracking with the least possible impact to the existing infrastructure and with no additional cost.
What should the company do to meet these requirements?
- [ ] Use a different EC2 instance type for each project.
- [ ] Publish project-specific custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics for each application.
- [ ] Deploy EC2 instances for each project in a separate AWS account.
- [ ] Use cost allocation tags with values that are specific to each project.
#### Correct Answer: D
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The #### Correct Answer is D because cost allocation tags are a way to track the infrastructure costs for each of the projects separately. Cost allocation tags are key-value pairs that can be attached to AWS resources, such as EC2
instances, and used to categorize and group them for billing purposes. The other options are incorrect because they do not meet the requirements of the ### Question. Use a different EC2 instance type for each project does not
help to track the costs for each project, and may impact the performance and compatibility of the applications. Publish project-specific custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics for each application does not help to track the
costs for each project, and may incur additional charges for using CloudWatch. Deploy EC2 instances for each project in a separate AWS account does help to track the costs for each project, but it impacts the existing
infrastructure and incurs additional charges for using multiple accounts. Reference: Using Cost Allocation Tags
### Question 107

- [ ] Virtual private gateway
- [ ] NAT gateway
- [ ] Customer gateway
E. Internet gateway
#### Correct Answer: B, D
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
The correct answers are B and D because a virtual private gateway and a customer gateway are components of an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A virtual private gateway is the AWS side of the VPN connection that
attaches to the customer's VPC. A customer gateway is the customer side of the VPN connection that resides in the customer's network. The other options are incorrect because they are not components of an AWS Site-toSite VPN connection. AWS Storage Gateway is a service that connects on-premises software applications with cloud-based storage. NAT gateway is a service that enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet
or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. Internet gateway is a service that enables communication between instances in a VPC and the internet. Reference: [What is

- [ ] Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances
- [ ] AWS Wavelength
- [ ] Application Load Balancer
IT Certification Exams - Questions & Answers | VCEplus.io
www.VCEplus.io
#### Correct Answer: B
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances are instances that you pay for by the second, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments4. This option is suitable for applications that have unpredictable or intermittent
workloads, such as the one described in the ### Question. Amazon EC2 Standard Reserved Instances are instances that you purchase for a one-year or three-year term, and pay a lower hourly rate compared to On-Demand
Instances. This option is suitable for applications that have steady state or predictable usage. AWS Wavelength is a service that enables developers to build applications that deliver ultra-low latency to mobile devices and
users by deploying AWS compute and storage at the edge of the 5G network. This option is not relevant for the application described in the ### Question. Application Load Balancer is a type of load balancer that operates at the
application layer and distributes traffic based on the content of the request. This option is not a service or feature to host the application, but rather to balance the traffic among multiple instances.
### Question 114
A company is using Amazon RDS.
A company is launching a critical business application in an AWS Region.
How can the company increase resilience for this application?
- [ ] Deploy a copy of the application in another AWS account.
- [ ] Deploy the application by using multiple VPCs.
- [ ] Deploy the application by using multiple subnets.
- [ ] Deploy the application by using multiple Availability Zones.
#### Correct Answer: D
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Deploying the application by using multiple Availability Zones is the best way to increase resilience for the application. According to the Amazon RDS User Guide, "Amazon RDS provides high availability and failover support for
DB instances using Multi-AZ deployments. In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary DB instance is
synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups."4 Deploying a copy of the application in another
AWS account, using multiple VPCs, or using multiple subnets do not provide the same level of resilience as using multiple Availability Zones.

#### Correct Answer: C
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
AWS Shield Standard and AWS WAF are the AWS services or tools that are designed to protect a workload from SQL injections, cross-site scripting, and DDoS attacks. According to the AWS Shield Developer Guide, "AWS
Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application
downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection."5 According to the AWS WAF Developer Guide, "AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web
applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to
create security rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define." VPC endpoint, virtual private gateway, and AWS Config are not
designed to protect a workload from these types of attacks.

### Question 120
How should the company deploy the application to meet these requirements?
- [ ] Ina single Availability Zone
- [ ] On AWS Direct Connect
- [ ] On Reserved Instances
- [ ] In multiple Availability Zones
#### Correct Answer: D
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Deploying the application in multiple Availability Zones is the best way to ensure high availability for the application. Availability Zones are isolated locations within an AWS Region that are engineered to be fault-tolerant from
failures in other Availability Zones. By deploying the application in multiple Availability Zones, the company can reduce the impact of outages and increase the resilience of the application. Deploying the application in a single
Availability Zone, on AWS Direct Connect, or on Reserved Instances does not provide the same level of high availability as deploying the application in multiple Availability Zones. Source: Availability Zones

E. Account activity records
#### Correct Answer: B, D
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
AWS Trusted Advisor is a service that provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommended actions in five categories: cost optimization,
performance, security, fault tolerance, and service quotas. Cost optimization helps you reduce your overall AWS costs by identifying idle and underutilized resources.
Service quotas helps you monitor and manage your usage of AWS service quotas and request quota increases. Operating system patches, repetitive tasks, and account activity records are not categories that AWS Trusted
Advisor provides recommended actions for. Source: [AWS Trusted Advisor]
### Question 123
Which actions are examples of a company's effort to right size its AWS resources to control cloud costs? (Select TWO.)
- [ ] Switch from Amazon RDS to Amazon DynamoDB to accommodate NoSQL datasets.
- [ ] Base the selection of Amazon EC2 instance types on past utilization patterns.
- [ ] Use Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies to move objects that users access infrequently to lower-cost storage tiers.
- [ ] Use Multi-AZ deployments for Amazon RDS.
E. Replace existing Amazon EC2 instances with AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
#### Correct Answer: B, C
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Basing the selection of Amazon EC2 instance types on past utilization patterns is a way to right size the AWS resources and optimize the performance and cost. Using Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies to move objects that users
access infrequently to lower-cost storage tiers is another way to reduce the storage costs and align them with the business value of the data. These two actions are recommended by the AWS Cost Optimization Pillar1.
Switching from Amazon RDS to Amazon DynamoDB is not necessarily a cost-saving action, as it depends on the use case and the data model.
Using Multi-AZ deployments for Amazon RDS is a way to improve the availability and durability of the database, but it also increases the cost. Replacing existing Amazon EC2 instances with AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a way to
simplify the deployment and management of the application, but it does not affect the cost of the underlying EC2 instances.
### Question 124
A company has a single Amazon EC2 instance. The company wants to adopt a highly available architecture.
What can the company do to meet this requirement?
- [ ] Scale vertically to a larger EC2 instance size.
- [ ] Scale horizontally across multiple Availability Zones.
- [ ] Purchase an EC2 Dedicated Instance.
- [ ] Change the EC2 instance family to a compute optimized instance.
#### Correct Answer: B
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
IT Certification Exams - Questions & Answers | VCEplus.io
www.VCEplus.io
Scaling horizontally across multiple Availability Zones is a way to adopt a highly available architecture, as it increases the fault tolerance and resilience of the application. Scaling vertically to a larger EC2 instance size is a way
to improve the performance of the application, but it does not improve the availability. Purchasing an EC2 Dedicated Instance is a way to isolate the instance from other AWS customers, but it does not improve the availability.
Changing the EC2 instance family to a compute optimized instance is a way to optimize the instance type for the workload, but it does not improve the availability. These concepts are explained in the AWS Well-Architected
Framework2.
### Question 125
A company is running an application that is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. The usage of the EC2 instances is higher during daytime hours than nighttime hours. The company wants to optimize the number of EC2 instances
based on this usage pattern.
Which AWS service or instance purchasing option should the company use to meet these requirements?
- [ ] Spot Instances
- [ ] Reserved Instances
- [ ] AWS CloudFormation
- [ ] AWS Auto Scaling
#### Correct Answer: D
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
AWS Auto Scaling is the AWS service that allows users to optimize the number of EC2 instances based on the usage pattern, as it automatically adjusts the capacity to maintain steady and predictable performance at the
lowest possible cost. Spot Instances are a way to reduce the cost of EC2 instances by bidding on unused EC2 capacity, but they are not suitable for applications that require steady and reliable performance. Reserved Instances
are a way to reduce the cost of EC2 instances by committing to a certain amount of usage for a period of time, but they are not flexible to adjust to the usage pattern. AWS CloudFormation is a way to automate the creation
and management of AWS resources, but it does not optimize the number of EC2 instances based on the usage pattern. These concepts are explained in the AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials course3.
### Question 126
A company is collecting user behavior patterns to identify how to meet goals for sustainability impact.
Which guidelines are best practices for the company to implement to meet these goals? (Select TWO.)

- [ ] Eliminate creation and maintenance of unused assets.
- [ ] Scale resources with excess capacity and remove auto scaling.
E. Scale infrastructure based on the number of users.
#### Correct Answer: A, C
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
To meet the goals for sustainability impact, the company should follow the best practices of scaling infrastructure with user load and eliminating creation and maintenance of unused assets. Scaling infrastructure with user
load means adjusting the capacity of the infrastructure to match the demand of the users, which can reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the system. Eliminating creation and maintenance of unused
assets means avoiding the waste of resources and money on assets that are not needed or used, which can also improve the environmental and economic efficiency of the system3.

### Question 137
A company has developed a distributed application that recovers gracefully from interruptions. The application periodically processes large volumes of data by using multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
The application is sometimes idle for months.
Which EC2 instance purchasing option is MOST cost-effective for this use case?
- [ ] Reserved Instances
- [ ] Spot Instances
- [ ] Dedicated Instances
- [ ] On-Demand Instances
#### Correct Answer: B
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Spot Instances are instances that use spare EC2 capacity that is available for up to 90% off the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances can be interrupted by EC2 with two minutes of notification when EC2 needs the
capacity back, you can use them for applications that have flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions5. This option is most cost-effective for the use case described in the ### Question. Reserved Instances are
instances that you purchase for a one-year or three-year term, and pay a lower hourly rate compared to On-Demand Instances. This option is suitable for applications that have steady state or predictable usage. Dedicated
Instances are instances that run on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer within an Amazon VPC. This option is suitable for applications that have stringent regulatory or compliance requirements. On-Demand
Instances are instances that you pay for by the second, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. This option is suitable for applications that have unpredictable or intermittent workloads.
### Question 138
A company is running workloads for multiple departments within a single VPC. The company needs to be able to bill each department for its resource usage.
Which action should the company take to accomplish this goal with the LEAST operational overhead?
- [ ] Add a department tag to each resource and configure cost allocation tags.
- [ ] Move each department resource to its own VPC.
- [ ] Move each department resource to its own AWS account.
- [ ] Use AWS Organizations to get a billing report for each department.
#### Correct Answer: A
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Adding a department tag to each resource and configuring cost allocation tags is an action that can help you accomplish the goal of billing each department for its resource usage with the least operational overhead. Tags are
simple labels consisting of a key and an optional value that you can assign to AWS resources. You can use tags to organize your resources and track your AWS costs on a detailed level. Cost allocation tags enable you to track
your AWS costs on a detailed level. After you activate cost allocation tags, AWS uses the cost allocation tags to organize your resource costs on your cost allocation report, to make it easier for you to categorize and track your
AWS costs2. Moving each department resource to its own VPC or its own AWS account is an action that can help you isolate and control the resources for each department, but it would incur more operational overhead than
using tags. Using AWS Organizations to get a billing report for each department is an action that can help you consolidate billing and payment across multiple AWS accounts, but it would not help you bill each department for
its resource usage within a single VPC.

- [ ] Use Amazon CloudFront as the database for the EC2 instances.
- [ ] Use EC2 instances in the same edge location and the same Availability Zone.
- [ ] Use EC2 instances in AWS OpsWorks stacks in different AWS Regions.
#### Correct Answer: A
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Using EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones in the same AWS Region is a solution that meets the requirements of sharing the same geographic area but using redundant underlying power sources. Availability Zones
are isolated locations within an AWS Region that have independent power, cooling, and physical security. They are connected through low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. By launching EC2
instances in different Availability Zones, users can increase the fault tolerance and availability of their applications. Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that speeds up the delivery of web content
and media to end users by caching it at the edge locations closer to them. It is not a database service and cannot be used to store operational data for EC2 instances. Edge locations are sites that are part of the Amazon
CloudFront network and are located in many cities around the world. They are not the same as Availability Zones and do not provide redundancy for EC2 instances. AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that
allows users to automate the deployment and management of applications using Chef or Puppet. It can be used to create stacks that span multiple AWS Regions, but this would not meet the requirement of sharing the same
geographic area.

#### Correct Answer: D
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
On-Demand Instances are the most flexible and cost-effective pricing model for short-term, experimental, or unpredictable workloads on AWS. On-Demand Instances let you pay only for the resources you use, without any
long-term commitments or upfront fees. You can easily start and stop instances as needed, and scale up or down depending on your demand.
Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Dedicated Hosts are all pricing models that require a commitment for a certain amount of usage or capacity for a one- or three-year term. These pricing models offer lower prices than
On-Demand Instances, but they are not suitable for workloads that only run for 3 to 6 months or have variable usage patterns. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances also offer flexibility to change instance types, sizes, or
regions within the same family or pool, while Dedicated Hosts are physical servers that can only run specific instance types.
### Question 173
Which action is a security best practice for access to sensitive data that is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket?
- [ ] Enable S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) on the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Use IAM roles for applications that require access to the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Configure AWS WAF to prevent unauthorized access to the S3 bucket.
- [ ] Configure Amazon GuardDuty to prevent unauthorized access to the S3 bucket.
#### Correct Answer: B
**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
Explanation:
Understanding IAM Roles: IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles in AWS are designed to delegate access permissions without sharing long-term security credentials. This means applications and services can use
temporary security credentials, which enhances security.
Why IAM Roles are Best Practice:
Least Privilege Principle: By using IAM roles, you can ensure that applications only have the minimum permissions they need to function, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
Temporary Credentials: Roles provide temporary security credentials, which reduce the risk if they are compromised compared to long-term access keys.
Automated Rotation: Temporary credentials automatically expire and are rotated, which means you don't have to manage the rotation manually.
How to Implement IAM Roles:
Create an IAM Role: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to IAM, and create a new role. Choose the type of trusted entity (e.g., EC2, Lambda).
Attach Policies: Attach the necessary policies to the role that define the permissions for accessing the S3 bucket.
Assign Role to Service: Attach the IAM role to your EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or other AWS services that need to access the S3 bucket.
Use AWS SDKs: When accessing S3 from your application, use the AWS SDKs to automatically assume the IAM role and obtain temporary credentials.
